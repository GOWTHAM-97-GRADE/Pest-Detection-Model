| 12 | Weevils | 485 |

### Pest Descriptions
- **Ants:** Can be both beneficial and harmful to crops.
- **Bees:** Essential pollinators but some species may be pests.
- **Beetles:** Damage crops by feeding on leaves, stems, or roots.
- **Caterpillars:** Larval stage of butterflies/moths; known for defoliating plants.
- **Earthworms:** Beneficial for soil aeration but may disrupt root structures.
- **Earwigs:** Nocturnal pests that feed on soft plant tissues.
- **Grasshoppers:** Cause significant foliage damage.
- **Moths:** Some larvae species are agricultural pests.
- **Slugs & Snails:** Soft-bodied pests that consume plant leaves and stems.
- **Wasps:** Some species prey on crops or disrupt farming.
- **Weevils:** Target stored grains and agricultural produce.

## Model Architecture
The **InceptionV3** model is used for classification, implemented using **PyTorch**. It consists of:
- Initial convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Two **Inception Modules** for multi-scale feature learning
- Fully connected layers for classification
- **Softmax output** for 12 pest categories

## Training & Evaluation
### Training Details
- **Dataset Split:**
  - Train: 80%
  - Validation: 10%
  - Test: 10%
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss
- **Optimizer:** Adam (learning rate: 0.001)
- **Batch Size:** 32
- **Epochs:** 30

### Validation & Testing
- The model is validated after each epoch.
- **Accuracy & Loss** are tracked.
- Final testing is done on unseen data.

## File Structure
```
Project_ML/
|-- Pest/
|   |-- pestDataset/  # Contains training images
|   |-- Output/
|       |-- pth/  # Model checkpoints
|   |-- main.py  # Training & testing script
```

## Model Checkpoints
- **Checkpoints saved at:** `/content/drive/MyDrive/Project_ML/Pest/Output/pth`
- The model is loaded from the latest checkpoint (`inception_v3_70.pth`) if available.

## Classification Example
To classify a single image, run:
```python
image_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Project_ML/Pest/pestDataset/snail/snail (116).jpg'
true_label = 'snail'  # Optional
classify_image(image_path, model, device, train_dataset.dataset.classes, true_label)
```
This will display the image along with the predicted class label.

## Authors & Source
- **Dataset:** Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vencerlanz09/agricultural-pests-image-dataset)
- **Project:** Open-source research for pest detection using deep learning.

## Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy with **transfer learning** and **data augmentation**.
- Optimize for **edge devices** for real-time agricultural monitoring.
- Deploy as a **web or mobile application** for practical usage.
